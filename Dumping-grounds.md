Upon the Night of Dweomers, when iron is made flesh and the Golden Scepter is wreathed in flames, the Copper Tower shall be restored
You cannot kill it with swords
Run away!
It's a trap
The walls listen
Bend the pin to reset the trap
The Emerald Legion killed a rust monster here
This is not a secret door
Explosive runes
Praise Shiva the Destroyer
"When song becomes silence, the Wand of Aether shall be destroyed." in draconic

You cannot kill it with wizardry
