http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002561/quotes done to  You fools! Do you think with your crosses and your wafers you can destroy me? Me! You do not know how many men have come against me. I am the king of my kind! 

The blood is the life... and it shall be mine. 
You fools! You think you can destroy me with your wafers and your wolf's-bane, Me, the King of my kind?! You shall see!

Upon the Night of Dweomers, when iron is made flesh and the Golden Scepter is wreathed in flames, the Copper Tower shall be restored
You cannot kill it with swords
Run away!
It's a trap
The walls listen
Explosive runes
