http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002561/quotes done to  You fools! Do you think with your crosses and your wafers you can destroy me? Me! You do not know how many men have come against me. I am the king of my kind! You have accomplished nothing, Van Helsing. Time is on my side. In a century, when you are dust, I shall wake and call Lucy, my queen from her grave. I have in my time had many brides, Mr. Harker. But I shall set Lucy above them all.

You fools! You think you can destroy me with your wafers and your wolf's-bane, Me, the King of my kind?! You shall see!
