 The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan
"Attack on ground where your enemy believes you will not, from an unexpected direction at an unexpected time. Defend where your enemy believes you are not, and when he believes you will run. Surprise is the key to victory, and speed is the key to surprise. For the soldier, speed is life." —Comadrin

A Song of Ice and Fire:

    The oath of the Night's Watch. 

Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come. 


Discworld: 
The millennia-old messenger golem Anghammarad remembers a Badass version of the A-M Post Office motto from the dawn of time: "Neither Deluge Nor Ice Storm Nor The Black Silence Of The Netherhells Shall Stay These Messengers About Their Sacred Business. Do Not Ask Us About Sabre-Tooth Tigers, Tar Pits, Big Green Things With Teeth Or The Goddess Czol." 

 The Road of Kings a poem written by Robert E. Howard that tells things from Conan's perspective after he becomes king of Aquilonia.
Gleaming shell of an outworn lie, fable of Right Divine.
You gained your crowns by heritage, but Blood was the price of mine.
The throne that I won by blood and sweat, by Crom, I will not sell
For promise of valleys filled with gold or threat of the Halls of Hell!

When I was a fighting man, the kettle-drums they beat.
The people scattered gold dust before my horse's feet.
But now I am a great king; the people hound my track,
With poison in my wine cup, and daggers at my back.

What do I know of cultured ways; the gilt, the craft and the lie?
I, who was born in a naked land, and bred in the open sky?
The subtle tongue, the sophist guile; they fail when the broadswords sing.
Rush in and die, dogs — I was a man before I was a king!

The First Horn (Heavy Infantry) form Richard Schwartz's series Das Geheimnis von Askir (translated):
Who are we?
The first horn of the bull!
What are we?
Steadfast!
Where do we stand?
On the ground from which we will not retreat!
Where do we go?
To the gods, with Askir, the emperor, our honour and our duty!
The Draka
Service to the State. Glory to the Race. 


Tennyson, "Sir Gallahad":
My good blade carves the casques of men,
My tough lance thrusteth sure,
My strength is as the strength of ten,
Because my heart is pure.

    Tennyson again, "Ulysses" 

Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

    And again, in "The Charge of the Light Brigade" 

Theirs not to make reply
Theirs not to reason why
Theirs but to do and die 

 Harry Dresden has several:
The world is getting weirder. Darker every single day. Things are spinning around faster and faster, and threatening to go completely awry. Falcons and falconers. The center cannot hold.
But in my corner of the country, I'm trying to nail things down. [...] I don't want to live in a world where the strong rule and the weak cower. I'd rather make a place where things are a little quieter. Where trolls stay the hell under their bridges, and where elves don't come swooping out to snatch children from their cradles. Where vampires respect the limits, and where the faeries mind their p's and q's.
My name is Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden. Conjure by it at your own risk. When things get strange, when what goes bump in the night flicks on the lights, when no one else can help you, give me a call. I'm in the book. 


 The Thirteenth Warrior:
Lo, there do I see my father
Lo, there do I see my mother and my sisters and my brothers
Lo, there do I see the line of my people, back to the beginning
Lo, they do call to me
They bid me take my place among them
In the halls of Valhalla
Where the brave
May live
Forever! 

* "In Rust We Trust."
