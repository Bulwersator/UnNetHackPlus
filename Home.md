But do I like the idea of them calling in the guard when they are up against an overwhelming erm, well, an opponent. http://bilious.alt.org/rgrn/?126678,126685,126686,126690,126691,126692,126694,126695,126696,126697,126698,126703,126704,126705,126709,126710,126713,126714,126724,127665
* Incidentally, there's a way to pacify the Minetown Watch in most cases. First, get a stack of blessed teleport scrolls. Teleport from the staircase to the inside of a shop, pick up an item, and then teleport right outside the entrance of that shop (but not in a line from the door!). As soon as the shopkeeper comes out to kill you, pay him for the thing you stole. The Watch will decide that since you are no longer a thief, it follows that you are no longer a criminal.

* I, and a few others, think magic resistance is too general an
attribute, covering too many scenarios. I reckon it should be split up
into mana/magic missile resistance (which gray DSM would confer), spell
resistance, and death resistance. While spell resistance would remain a
high priority, the others would be precautionary measures (much like
acid resistance is now.) https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/TrtHf-9b8SU

* https://github.com/Bulwersator/CopyOfSporkHack/commit/dfb47e58a21a9e50a60245309f1c91ec53310457 -  Scared covetous monsters should actually 'flee' to someplace not near the player.  Note that this doesn't include STRAT_HEAL, only magical sources of fear.

* devastating Wand of Death, which would shave hit points off of Mouse's MAXIMUM every time it hits him even if his amulet reflects the killing charge
* And here we have the monster spell Destroy Armor. In vanilla, Mouse's +1 iron shoes would simply disintegrate and blow away, and he'd be out that item of armor. In Sporkhack, an undamaged article such as Mouse's shoes must be hit by the spell two to four times before being completely destroyed, each time taking between one and three instances of rust, corrosion, burn, or rot damage. There is a one-in-three chance that it will take two castings, and a one-in-twenty-seven chance it will take four castings, with the remainder taking three castings. In this case, Mouse's shoes become 'thoroughly rusted' following the naga's spell, so the next Destroy Armor spell to hit his shoes will destroy them utterly. On the other hand, things turn around in vanilla when Mouse gets magic resistance, because in vanilla magic resistance makes him completely immune to that monster spell. In Sporkhack, however, the Destroy Armor spell will pierce magic resistance just enough that it will deal just one level of damage, meaning four castings on the same piece of armor will destroy it in spite of magic resistance and corrosionproofing. You don't want this to happen to your Cloak of Magic Resistance, so for heaven's sake repair it whenever you get the chance.
* Beware the Minetown bones file where the altar has been converted. The priest present may be peaceful, but he or she will go hostile if you #chat.
*  Gems the unicorn keeps are worth +2 luck, and the unicorn doesn't care if they're diamonds or turquoise. If it becomes convenient later, you can bring a strong pet to withdraw your deposit from the Bank of Uni, but I don't always bother. (make only alive unicorns bring luck)

*Enemies have a variety of taunts. It really makes me feel awesome when my character is killing stuff and there are two different leader-monsters making distinct sorts of conversation. It doesn't really have any numerical meaning, but I think it's a really nice touch as far as verisimilitude goes. "Why can't you fools kill him? He is only one man!"
* http://i295.photobucket.com/albums/mm153/Kobold_Lord/Sporkhack%202/T645341.jpg http://i295.photobucket.com/albums/mm153/Kobold_Lord/Sporkhack%202/T645342.jpg This message is caused by a new divine monster spell. The hill giant shaman has just inflicted the cold vulnerability intrinsic on Mouse. It eventually wears off, but until then Mouse will take heavy damage from cold attacks even though he has 100% cold resistance. You REALLY do not want to get hit by cold attacks if you have cold vulnerability and 0% cold resistance.
* Here's his frost spell. It's kind of sad. This spell is unique to Asmodeus, but PCs almost ALWAYS have perfect frost resistance by this point in the game
*  This is the ideal place to settle in when clearing the Zoo at Fort Ludios. Doors have the interesting property that even when they are opened, you can only go through them straight on. The monsters have to single file through three tiles, and in the last of the three they'll stop to fight Spelunky. Until she kills the monster she faces, the others will get jammed behind it. None of them can line up to zap a wand, either, until they're already in melee with Spelunky. http://i295.photobucket.com/albums/mm153/Kobold_Lord/Sporkhack%203/T28982.jpg

* When I found the black market (the portal was on the nymphs level), I 
had a few thousand zorkmids prepared. I wanted to buy a magic whistle. 
But all whistles in the shop were tin ones. I was somewhat desperate, 
until I realized that I could have solved my problem much earlier. I did 
have a tin whistle even from mine town (tried whether using it would 
train my pets to come to the stairs, but could not see any effect). I 
also had a potion of gain level. And now I remembered (didn't I say my 
game skills were rusty?) that you can use potions of gain level to 
upgrade objects. I dipped the tin whistle into the potion and was the 
proud owner of a magic whistle.
* unflee zombies on low HP
* Dragons will never breath in melee combat.
* Only your quest Nemeses will deliberately steal your quest artifact, other monsters may steal the amulet and invocation items. The quest artifact may of course be randomly stolen by nymphs and the like.  -Makes QA a dependable source of extrinsics, deepening differences between classes. -dnethack
* Unskilled use of weapons will get you occasional reminders that you suck at this. No matter how many bonuses you get, in Sporkhack you can never get more than a 75% chance to hit a monster with such a weapon. This is only a minor hassle with this artifact longsword, since Mouse will be at basic skill with it shortly, but this is a big nerf to the rubber chicken exploit. No longer is a wielded cockatrice corpse automatic instant victory against even endgame bosses; there is at least a 25% chance the boss will be able to hit back at least once. This is a bigger nerf than it sounds… Since there are no artifact corpses to receive as a gift from your god, no character will ever be skilled in their use. You could say that there's no 'right way' to beat somebody with a dead chicken.

#texts
*  Juiblex the Lord of the Slime Pit, Demon Lord of Oozes and All Things Most Foul.
* I dunno, I often hear this about Roguelikes and other really hard games, and to the extent that it's true at all, it assumes that the player has read and memorized every single spoiler and knows that (say) Blue-Footed Foozles can be defeated by harsh language but will explode with 40-kiloton yield if struck by any spell or weapon.

#help!
* Gargoyle weirdness (There are animated statues so it is logical that they are stone resistant. On the other hand their flesh is edible. I want to turn them into statue leaving monster like stone golem - but what should happen with stone monster hit by stone to flesh spell? Turn into meatball as for statues of monsters without corpses? Resist as their stone is also body? Do nothing? Eat significant part of HP (body of foo decays into twisted flesh)? Something else? )
